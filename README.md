# damowmow-server  
## A server for simple patterns available at ``ws://treeplate.damowmow.com:8001``.<br>  
It takes an input and a pattern like so:    
``<pattern> <input>``  
where ``?`` means anything  
  
The output returns whether it satisfies it and what the value of the questionmarks are with the syntax:  
``<satisfies?>,<values separated by commas>``
